        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          In mathematics, a <strong>hypergraph</strong> is a generalization of a
          graph in which an edge can join any number of vertices. In contrast,
          in an ordinary graph, an edge connects exactly two vertices.<a
            href="#ref11"
            class="ref"
            >[11]</a
          ><br />
          A <strong>tuple</strong> is a subset of vertices of such graph.<br />
          A <strong>hyperedge</strong> is a single connection that can join any
          number of vertices at once, for example, all vertices of a
          \(t-tuple\), unlike a usual edge which joins only 2.<br />
          A <strong>coloring</strong> is a mapping of \(t\) tuples into
          \(k\) colors (assigning particular color to a tuple of vertices).
          A coloring is called \((t,k,f)-polychromatic\) if each hyperedge
          that has at least \(f\) vertices, contains tuples of all the \(k\) colors.<br />
          \(f_{\mathcal{H}}(2,k)\) is the smallest number of vertices
          \(f\) such that we can color all \(t-tuples\) of a
          hypergraph \(H\) with \(k\) colors.<br />
          In this piece we focus on the case of \(2-tuples\) (pairs), i.e.
          \(t=2\).

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          First, we briefly recall the notion of
          <strong>cover-decomposition</strong>. Suppose we have many geometric
          shapes (disks, squares, polygons) that together cover every point of
          some region, and in fact every point is covered several times. A
          family of shapes is called <em>cover-decomposable</em> if, whenever
          the covering is thick enough, we can split the shapes into a few
          groups (typically 2) so that each group still covers every point. In
          the \(2-color\) case, this means we can color each shape red or blue,
          without moving or cutting any shape, in such a way that every point is
          covered by at least one red shape and at least one blue shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Polychromatic coloring</strong> and
          <strong>cover-decomposition</strong> are interwined concepts in
          hypergraph theory with a rich history. The core idea is to color
          vertices so that every sufficiently large hyperedge is
          <em>polychromatic</em> - meaning it contains points of all the
          different colors. These problems have been studied since 1980s
          <a
            href="#ref4"
            class="ref"
            >[4]</a
          > and remain a lively area of research today
          <a
            href="#ref2"
            class="ref"
            >[1,2]</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key question that sparked much of this study was posed by Pach in
          1980 <a
          href="#ref10"
          class="ref"
          >[10]</a
        >. He asked whether there is a universal constant
          \(f\) such that any finite set of points in the plane can be
          colored with 2 colors in a way that every unit disk containing at
          least \(f\) of these points will have points of both colors. In
          other words, can we avoid a one-color <em>monochromatic</em> disk no
          matter how we 2-color the plane, provided the disk covers sufficiently
          many points. In 2016 Pach and Pálvölgyi <a
          href="#ref5"
          class="ref"
          >[5]</a
        > proved that the answer is
          no - for any number \(f \in \mathbb{N}\), there's a finite set of points
          \(P\) in the plane such that for any 2-coloring of \(P\),
          one can find a unit disk containing at least \(f\) points of one
          color only. Their result showed that unit disks in the plane are not
          <em>cover-decomposable</em> under 2-colorings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, researchers considered similar questions for other shapes
          and for more than 2 colors. For instance, if the region is a convex
          polygon instead of a disk, the outcome is positive. Pálvölgyi and Tóth
          <a
            href="#ref6"
            class="ref"
            >[6]</a
          > showed that convex polygons are cover-decomposable. Subsequent
          work even improved the bounds, showing that one can choose
          \(f(k)\) on the order of \(k\) <a
          href="#ref7"
          class="ref"
          >[7]</a
        >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difficulty with disks and other non-cover-decomposable cases
          naturally leads to a question: if coloring single vertices doesn't
          work, could we color larger groups of vertices instead? This idea
          gives rise to <strong>tuple coloring</strong>, a generalization of the
          problem. Instead of assigning colors to individual points, we assign
          colors to every ordered tuple of \(t\) points.

        <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
        <p>First we explain defintions required to proceed.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Shrinkability</strong> is a hypergraph property when any
          hyperedge \(e\) can be shrinked to a sub-edge \(e'\) of any
          desired size(up to the size of the initial hyperedge) and that
          sub-edge is still an edge of the hypergraph.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>VC-dimension</strong> of a hypergraph is a measure of its
          complexity. A set of points \(X\) is said to be
          <strong>shattered</strong> in a hypergraph \(H\) if, by intersecting edges
          with \(X\) we can realize every possible pattern of which points
          of \(X\) are inside and which are outside, in other words 
          <em>shatter</em> the points. <strong>VC-dimension</strong> of a hypergraph 
          is the size of the largest <em>shattered</em> set.

        <p>
          <strong>Depth</strong> of a tuple \(d_H(S)\), \(S \subseteq V\)</em> 
          is the minimum number of other vertices included inside the disk, 
          formed by \(S\), in other words how many other points the disk containing 
          the tuple is forced to include. No matter which hyperedge we pick that 
          contains this tuple, we are forced to take \(d_H(S)\) other vertices
          along with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          \(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon\text{-}t\textbf{-Net}}\) is a subset of \(t-tuples\) of \(V\) if 
          any hyperedge in \(E\) (whose size is up to \(|V|)\) contains at least one 
          of the chosen \(t-tuples\).

        <h2>Polychromatic Pairs in Disks — the \(3.7^{k}\) Threshold</h2>
        <p>We start by presenting upper bounds on \(f(t,k)\) for hypergraphs. It is interesting
          because for abstract hypergraphs, \(f(t,k)\) is <u>unbounded</u> even if the hypergraph is 
          uniform(all hyperedges have the same size) and \(k\) (number of colors) is 2. This is due to

                Let \(\mathcal{H}\) be the family that contains any hypergraph \(H\) that can be obtained
                by taking a finite set \(P\) of points in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) in general position, setting
                \(V(H) := P\) and
                \(E(H) := \{ d \cap P : d \text{ is a disk in } \mathbb{R}^2 \}\).
                Then, for any natural number \(k\), it holds that

          In other words, for any finite set \(P\) of points in the plane, the
          \(\binom{|P|}{2}\) pairs of points can be \(k\)-colored such that any disk 
          containing at least \(3.7^{k}\) points must also contain a pair of points 
          from each of the \(k\) color classes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next demo we illustrate the \(f_{\mathcal{H}}(2,k) \le 3.7^{k}\) bound using 
          a random point set in the plane. We first generate a cloud of random points and rescale them 
          to fit nicely in the viewport. Then we draw a disk that one can move and resize. At any moment
          we look only at the points currently inside the disk. For every pair of points inside, we compute 
          its <strong>depth</strong>: we look at all circles that go through the pair (one defined by the 
          pair as a diameter, and the circumcircles obtained by adding each possible third point) and take the 
          circle with the least amount of points inside. The <strong>depth</strong> is the number of 
          <em>other</em> points that this circle is forced to include. Deeper pairs (i.e. pairs surrounded by 
          many other pairs) get higher colors in the list. Concretely, we bucket the depth into ranges that grow
          like powers of \(3.7\): color 1 is shallow pairs, color 2 is pairs with depth between
          \(3.7\) and \(3.7^{2}\), and so on up to \(k\) colors.

          The interface allows to choose the number of colors \(k \in \{3,4,5\}\) and the total number of points
          (up to 200). At each frame, the app only draws edges between points that lie entirely inside the disk
          and colors them according to their depth bucket. An informative leged in the top-left corner shows which colors
          actually appear inside the current disk; as soon as all \(k\) colors are present, the app labels the 
          disk as <strong>polychromatic</strong> - visually echoing the theoretical statement that once a disk 
          contains enough points (on the order of \(3.7^{k}\)), it must contain edges of all colors. For small \(k\)
          and moderate point counts this is easy to see. However, for larger \(k\), the required depths blow up since
          \(3.7^{k}\) grows fast, the deep colors become rare and the computation gets heavy enough that the browser
          start to lag.

            We start by placing \( n \times n \) grid of points and color each point independently 
            with one of the \(k\) colors (you can choose \(3 \le k \le 5\) and up to 200 points). 
            To explore the theorem, one can draw an axis-parallel rectangle by clicking and dragging. 
            When a mouse is released, we look only at the grid points inside the drawn rectangle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside that rectangle we count, for each color, how many points of that color are inside.  
            Let \(M\) be the largest of these counts \(-\) this is the size of the most frequent color 
            class in the rectangle. We highlight those \(M\) points and show three numbers in the legend:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>\(M\) \(-\) the largest number of points of a single color inside the rectangle;</li>
            <li>\(\sqrt{k \ln k}\) \(-\) the theoretical scale from Theorem 1.7, which says that
                \(f_{\mathcal H}(2,k) \le \sqrt{c\,k\ln k}\) for some constant \(c \ge 126\);</li>
            <li>\(\hat c\) \(-\) an experimental estimate of the constant, computed as
                \(\hat c = \dfrac{M^2}{k \ln k}\).  
                This comes from rearranging the formula \(M \approx \sqrt{c\,k\ln k}\).</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Note that once the user fixes \(k\), the value \(k \ln k\) is constant, so changing the 
            rectangle only affects \(M\) and therefore the observed \(\hat c\). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of the visualization is to give an intuition that the largest monochromatic 
            cluster inside a rectangle grows on the order of \(\sqrt{k \ln k}\), up to the constant \(c\).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the next demo we switch from axis-parallel rectangles to disks and to coloring the <em>points</em> 
            themselves rather than pairs. Instead of asking when a range becomes fully polychromatic, we now ask 
            the opposite question: how big can a <em>monochromatic</em> unit disk be? For a random coloring of 
            the points with \(k\) colors, the app searches for the unit disk that captures the largest number \(M\)
            of points of a single color and compares this to the theoretical scale \(\sqrt{k \ln k}\). In this way, 
            the rectangle demo and the disk demo give two complement views on how color classes can cluster inside
            geometric ranges.

            The radius of the disk is fixed, only its center and color change. At startup (and whenever we change 
            the number of points or colors), we look for the "worst" monochromatic unit disk: a disk of radius 1
            that contains as many points of a single color as possible. This "worst" in the sense that it most
            strongly concentrates one color and comes closest to violating the expected bound on how large such a
            monochromatic cluster should be. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We proceed as follows. First, we split all points into buckets by color, one bucket for each of \(k\)
            colors. For each bucket we search over many possible disk centers and find the maximum number \(M\) 
            of points of that color that can fit inside one unit disk. This gives us an \(M\) for each color. We then
            pick a color whose \(M\) is largest - this is the color with the "worst" unit disk. In the demo, we draw 
            that disk, color with the dominant color, highlight the points it contains, and report the values of \(M\),
            \(\sqrt{k \ln k}\), and the empirical constant \(\hat c = \dfrac{M^2}{k \ln k}\) in the legend.
          </p>
          <p>
            The demo also has an interactive element: the user can click anywhere in the viewport to move the center
            of the unit disk to that point. For this chosen center, we look at all points currently inside the disk, 
            find which color occurs most often (the "heaviest" color), and show its count \(M\). The disk is then drawn 
            in that color and the points of that color inside the disk are highlighted. This allows to visually inspect
            how large monochromatic clusters look in practice.

        <h2>Deep tuples in disks</h2>
        <p>
          After our previous demos, we have a fairly good intuition for how many points are needed so that every
          rectangle or disk is polychromatic for pairs. But this still lives in the world of 2-tuples and specific 
          geometric shapes. Now, we would like to take a more global viewpoint: instead of asking that every large
          region be colorful, we look for small "core" tuples of vertices that are contained in many hyperedges.
          A \((d+1)\) \(-\) tuple \(T\) with large depth \(d_{H}(T)\) is a very "popular" configuration(pattern
          inside the whole point set): any disk (or hyperedge) that contains \(T\) is forced to contain at least \(n/c\)
          other vertices. So \(T\) is a configuration that never appear alone \(-\) any range that catches it must
          also catch many more points.

                For every hypergraph \(H\) with VC-dimension at least \(2\) and at most \(d\) and
                with \(n \ge 2d + 2\) vertices there exists a \((d+1)\)-tuple \(T\) of vertices
                such that \(d_H(T) \ge \frac{n}{c}\), for \(c = 4(d+1)^{d+1}\).

          The theorem 1.10 guarantees the existence of a <strong>heavy 4-tuple</strong> whose depth is linear in \(n\) i.e. at least
          \(\frac{n}{c}\) for some constant \(c\). Our visualization randomly samples 4-tuples, finds one with with large depth, and

          Trying <em>all</em> 4-tuples would be far to expensive: there are \(\binom{n}{4}\) of them.
          Instead, the code does a Monte Carlo search. It repeatedly picks four random points, computes the 
          smallest circle that contains exactly these four (by checking circles through two or three of them),
          and then counts how many other points also lie inside that circle. This count minus \(4\) is the <strong>depth</strong>
          of that 4-tuple. During the simulation we keep track of the deepest 4-tuple we have seen so far and 
          display its circle and points in black, giving a concrete example of a "heavy" 4-tuple. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The demo is also interactive. When one clicks on a point in the picture, we treat it as an "anchor" and
          only look at 4-tuples that contain this clicked point. Among many random 4-tuples containing it, we again 
          search for the one with the largest depth: for each candidate 4-tuple we compute its smallest enclosing circle
          and count how many other points fall inside. The user defined 4-tuple with the best score is shown in red and
          its four defining points are highlighted as well. By clicking on points one can see how the depth changes 
          from place to place, giving a more local feeling for how "heavy" 4-tuples behave in this point set.

        <h2>\(\varepsilon-t-Nets\) for Pairs in Disk Range Spaces</h2>
        <p>
          After searching for a single deep \((d+1)-\)tuple in our point set, it's natural to ask for something stronger:
          can we find many special tuples that collectively "guard" all large hyperedges? ("guard", in the sense that every 
          large enough hyperedge contains at least one of them.) This is exactly what \(\varepsilon-t-nets\) do. Instead of 
          one heavy 4-tuple, an \(\varepsilon-t-net\) is a collection of \(t-\)tuples with the property that every hyperedge
          that is large enough (contains at least an \(\varepsilon-\)fraction of all vertices) must contain at least one of
          these tuples.

            To illustrate the theorem above, we switch to a one-dimensional setting by placing

            hyperedges as intervals on that line (i.e., contiguous blocks of points). A slider 
            lets the user choose the value of \(\varepsilon\). An \(\varepsilon\)-2-net is then a 
            collection of pairs of points (drawn as arcs or line segments above the line) such that

            We use neighboring points as our “guards” because in one dimension every interval
            that contains many points must also contain many <em>consecutive</em> pairs. If you look at
            a long block of equally spaced points on a line, you can always walk through it by
            stepping from one point to the next. So it is enough to choose some of these adjacent
            pairs as our guard set: if an interval is large (has at least \(\varepsilon n\) points),
            we expect it to contain at least one of the chosen pairs.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To examine the \(\varepsilon-2-net\) property interactively, we let the user draw an
            interval on the line, which represents a hyperedge in this 1D range space. Once the
            interval is fixed, we count how many points it contains and compare this to the
            threshold \(\varepsilon n\). If the interval is small (fewer than \(\varepsilon n\) points),
            the theorem does not guarantee anything, so it is fine if no guard pair appears inside.
            But if the interval is large (at least \(\varepsilon n\) points), the definition of an
            \(\varepsilon\)-2-net says it <strong>must</strong> contain at least one guard pair. In the
            demo, whenever this happens, we highlight a guard pair inside the selected interval
            in green. This visually confirms the statement of the theorem: every “heavy”
            interval (heavy = contains at least \(\varepsilon n\) points) is hit by our precomputed
            set of guard pairs.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This project makes the abstract theory of polychromatic coloring of tuples in hypergraphs
          feel concrete and visual. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on actual point sets, disks, rectangles, and 
          one-dimensional interval models. The goal is to reproduce theoretical findings, and to give geometric intuition
          for why such results are reasonable and how the underlying structures behave.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          In the first demos we focused on coloring <em>pairs</em> of points and looked at how many points a disk or
          an axis-parallel rectangle must contain before it is “forced” to see all colors.
          For disks, the \(3.7^k\) threshold illustrates and exponential dependence on the number of colors.
          For axis-parallel rectangles on a grid, the \(\sqrt{c\,k \ln k}\) behavior shows a much more
          midler but still systematic growth in the required number of points. This contrast highlights how the 
          same tuple-coloring framework can lead to very different thresholds for polychromaticity:
          exponential in \(k\) for disks, but almost square-root in \(k\) for grid rectangles.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          We then moved from “how many colors appear?” to “how deep can a tuple sit?” by studying heavy
          \((d+1)-\)tuples in range spaces of bounded VC-dimension. The heavy 4-tuple demo for disks is a
          visual companion to the theorem guaranteeing a \((d+1)-\)tuple of depth \(\Omega(n)\): no matter how
          we place the points, there is a small configuration of points that is surrounded by many others
          in every hyperedge that contains it. Finally, the \(\varepsilon\)-\(t\)-net demo in 1D recasts these ideas
          in terms of <em>guards</em>: carefully chosen tuples that every “large enough” hyperedge must contain,
          connecting tuple coloring with sampling and hitting sets.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Together, these experiments show a common theme: once a hypergraph (or geometric range space)
          has enough structure—coming from geometry, bounded VC-dimension, or shrinkability—then we can impose
          surprisingly strong coloring and guarding constraints on it.
